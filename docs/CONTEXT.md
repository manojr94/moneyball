# Project Context & Decision Log

Running notes for anyone (human or agent) picking up this project. Read
`docs/REQUIREMENTS.md` first — this file records the decisions *behind* it and the
state of play.

## Where we are

- Requirements one-pager written (`docs/REQUIREMENTS.md`).
- No application code written yet.
- Next deliverable: the implementation plan (milestones, schema, API surface, test
  strategy, commit sequence). **No code until that plan is agreed.**

## Product decisions (settled)

| Decision | Choice | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| **Analytics depth** | Basic aggregates **and** compa-ratio, sequenced in that order | Compa-ratio is a superset — it reuses the filtering, grouping, and pagination layer aggregates require. Building aggregates first means the harder feature lands on proven infrastructure. |
| **Access model** | Two roles: HR Admin (read/write) + Viewer (read-only) | Exercises real authorization design without the cost of a full permission system. Viewer maps to a genuine user (finance/exec stakeholder who needs reports, not edit rights). |
| **Deployment** | Public demo with seeded synthetic data | The project is portfolio work; a clickable demo is worth more than screenshots. Build 12-factor from day one so hosting is configuration, not a rewrite. |
| **Currency** | Store local currency + USD normalization, with the FX rate snapshotted per record | Cross-country analytics needs a common unit, but converting at read time would make historical reports silently change as rates move. Snapshotting keeps past figures stable. |

## Architectural decisions (proposed, not yet built)

1. **Salary is an append-only, effective-dated series** — a `salaries` table with
   `effective_date`, not a mutable `salary` column on `employees`. Makes point-in-time
   questions answerable, makes the audit trail structural rather than bolted on, and
   means no edit can destroy history. This is the load-bearing decision in the whole
   design; most other things follow from it.

2. **Money as integer minor units** (`amount_cents` + `currency`), never floats.
   Floating-point currency is a correctness bug, not a style preference.

3. **Salary bands are first-class data** (`salary_bands`: role, level, country,
   currency, min/mid/max, effective dates) rather than derived or hardcoded. Compa-ratio
   is meaningless without them, and they change over time like salaries do.

4. **Band resolution is an explicit service object**, not a scope or a join. The edge
   cases are the interesting part: no matching band, band in a different currency than
   the salary, band changed mid-period. These deserve isolated, well-tested logic.

## Open questions (need answers before schema is final)

1. Do salary bands vary **by country**, or by broader **geographic zone**? Current
   assumption: per-country. Affects the `salary_bands` uniqueness constraint.
2. Does analytics need a **region tier above country** (e.g. EMEA / APAC / NA), or is
   per-country grouping sufficient? Affects whether `regions` becomes a table.

## Working agreements

- **Nothing is pushed to GitHub without explicit approval.** The commit history is a
  deliverable in its own right and must read cleanly.
- Local commits are treated as **draft** until approved — they can be amended,
  squashed, reordered, or split before anything is published.
- Before any push, the full commit sequence (messages + diffstat) is reviewed.

## Environment note

The stack (Rails API + PostgreSQL, React SPA) is scaffolded locally under `backend/`
and `frontend/`. Work on this project from a **local** Claude Code session so the agent
can read the real tree, run migrations, and run tests directly. Cloud sessions only see
what has been pushed to GitHub.
